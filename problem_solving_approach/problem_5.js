Rail Cipher
Problem
  - Input => string message and number of rails
  - Output => string of encoded message 

  - Given a string message and a number representing the number of rails
    encode the message with the require number of rails

  - Starting with the first letter at the first position of the first rail,
    each subsequent letter is written on the next rail
  - Each time you move to the next rail, you should move forward 2 positions
  - move up and down the rails, for example, if there are 3 rails and you just 
    wrote the 3rd letter on the last (3rd) rail, the next letter should be written on the 2nd rail, then the 1st, etc.
  - Every 2nd position should contain a period, unless it already contains a letter
  - Return a string from a combination of all the letters from each rail in the order it's written on the rail
Examples
  - "WE ARE DISCOVERED FLEE AT ONCE"
  => W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E
     . E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C
     . . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N     
Data Structure
  - Nested array (Array of rails)
Algorithm  
  - Given a message (string) and a railCount (number)
  1. remove all spaces from the message
  2. intialize a nested array with an inner empty array for each rail
  3. initialize position to 0
  4. initialize railNumber to 0
  5. intialize a direction variable to 'up'
  6. loop over the message, for each character
     6a. rails[railNumber][position] = character
     6b. increment position by 2
     6c. if direction === 'up
          6ca. increment railNumber by 1
        else (direction is 'down')
          6cb. decrement railNumber by 1
     6e. if (railNumber === railCount - 1)
          6ea. direction = 'down'
         else if (railNumber === 0) 
          6eb. direction = 'up 
  7. loop over the rails, for each rail
    7a. loop over the rail, for each 2nd railPosition
      7ab. if the railPosition contains a letter
            7aba. continue
           else
            7abb. fill the railPosition with a period
  8. loop over the rails, for each rail
    8a. filter the rail to contains only the characters
    8b. combine the characters into a word
  9. combine the words
